	/**
	 * Returns the minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t (including multiplicity).
	 *
	 * Algorithm: sliding window with two frequency maps:
	 *  - need: what counts of characters we need (from t)
	 *  - window: what counts of characters the current window [left..right] has
	 *
	 * We maintain:
	 *  - needCount = number of distinct characters required (size of need map)
	 *  - have = number of distinct characters in 'window' whose counts meet or exceed need's counts
	 *
	 * Expand by moving right and updating window counts, updating 'have' when a character's count
	 * reaches exactly the needed count. When have == needCount the current window contains all required
	 * characters (maybe with extras). Then we try to shrink from left to find a smaller valid window.
	 *
	 * Time complexity: O(|s| + |t|) (each character is visited at most twice - once when right expands and
	 * once when left shrinks).
	 * Space complexity: O(k) where k is number of distinct chars (size of maps) â€” can be reduced to O(1)
	 * if alphabet is fixed and small by using int arrays.
